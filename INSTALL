# Installation instructions

The following instructions apply for building from source only. For binary versions, you can run the game by opening the executable file named "game" / "game.exe" / "game.app" (no Blender required)

- You need to install Blender first ( https://www.blender.org/ )
- Open the command window and cd to the game main directory (which contains .blend files)
- Run the following command:
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b otw.blend -P install.py

* For developers:
- If you want to make modifications to blend files, you should choose *_src.blend files to edit and run the following commands:
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b terrain_src.blend -P build_terrain.py (for terrain_src.blend)
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b items_src.blend -P build_item.py (for items_src.blend)
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b penguin_src.blend -P build_penguin.py (for penguin_src.blend, note that this file contains models from items.blend)
- To build levels, run the following command for each:
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b levels/<folder>/terrain_data_src.blend -P levels/cut_terrain.py

- Now you can run the game by opening the file named "otw" / "otw.exe" / "otw.app" (which depends on the OS)
