# Installation instructions

The following instructions apply for building from source only. For binary versions, you can run the game by opening the executable file named "game" / "game.exe" / "game.app" (no Blender required)

- You need to install Blender first ( https://www.blender.org/ )
- Open the command window and cd to the game main directory (which contains .blend files)
- Run the following command:
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b otw.blend -P install.py

# For developers:
- If you want to make modifications to blend files, you should choose *_src.blend files to edit and run the following commands:
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b terrain_src.blend -P build_terrain.py (for terrain_src.blend)
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b items_src.blend -P build_item.py (for items_src.blend)
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b penguin_src.blend -P build_penguin.py (for penguin_src.blend, note that this file contains models from items.blend)

 If you are using GNU/Linux or Bash shell, you can run the following command:
 cd <path/to/game/folder>
 sh install.sh <path/to/Blender/executable> (optional, default to "blender")

- To build worlds, run the following commands for each:
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b <path/to/world/folder>/<src blend file> -P worlds/separate_terrain_files.py
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b <path/to/world/folder>/tmp/<blend file> -P worlds/cut_terrain.py
 
 If you are using GNU/Linux or Bash shell, you can run the following command:
 cd <path/to/game/folder>
 sh worlds/install_world.sh <path/to/world/folder> <path/to/Blender/executable> (optional, default to "blender")

- Now you can run the game by opening the file named "otw" / "otw.exe" / "otw.app" (which depends on the OS)
