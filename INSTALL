# Installation instructions

The following instructions apply for building from source only. For binary versions, you can run the game by opening the executable file named "game" / "game.exe" / "game.app" (no Blender required)

- You need to install Blender first ( https://www.blender.org/ )
- Open the command window and cd to the game main directory (which contains .blend files)
- Run the following commands in the right order:
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b terrain_src.blend -P build_terrain.py
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b items_src.blend -P build_item.py
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b penguin_src.blend -P build_penguin.py
 <path/to/Blender/executable> -b game.blend -P install.py
- Now you can run the game by opening the file named "game" / "game.exe" / "game.app" (which depends on the OS)
