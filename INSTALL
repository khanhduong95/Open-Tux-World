1. Method 1 (no installation required, only applies to released versions)

You can run the game by opening the executable file named "game" / "game.exe" / "game.app" (no Blender required)

2. Method 2

You need to install Blender first, then open the game.blend file with Blender (or game_test.blend if you wish to modify the source), enable the addon to export game runtime (File > User Preferences > Addons > Game Engine: Save As Game Engine Runtime) and export it as game engine runtime (File > Export > Save As Game Engine Runtime)
